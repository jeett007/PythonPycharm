# Python Math Tasks

This repository contains two simple Python programs that demonstrate basic mathematical operations.

## Task 1: Factorial Calculator
- This program defines a function to calculate the factorial of a given number using a loop.
- If the number is negative, it informs the user that factorials are not defined for negative numbers.
- **Sample Usage:** `factorial(5)` returns `120`.

### File: `factorial_calculator.py`

## Task 2: Math Module Calculations
- This program:
  - Takes a number as input from the user.
  - Calculates the square root, natural logarithm (base e), and sine (in radians) of the number using Python's `math` module.
- **Sample Input:** 25  
- **Output:** Displays the calculated square root, log, and sine.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run each script using Python 3.

```bash
python factorial_calculator.py
python math_module_calculations.py
