# Python Math Tasks

This repository contains two simple Python programs that demonstrate basic mathematical operations.

## Task 1: Factorial Calculator
- This program defines a function to calculate the factorial of a given number using a loop.
- If the number is negative, it informs the user that factorials are not defined for negative numbers.
- **Sample Usage:** `factorial(5)` returns `120`.

### File: `factorial_calculator.py`

## Task 2: Math Module Calculations
- This program:
  - Takes a number as input from the user.
  - Calculates the square root, natural logarithm (base e), and sine (in radians) of the number using Python's `math` module.
- **Sample Input:** 25  
- **Output:** Displays the calculated square root, log, and sine.

### File: `math_module_calculations.py`

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run each script using Python 3.

```bash
python factorial_calculator.py
python math_module_calculations.py
# File Handling in Python

This repository contains Python scripts demonstrating basic file handling operations, including reading, writing, and appending to text files with error handling.

## Task 1: Read a File and Handle Errors
- Reads content from a file named `sample.txt`.
- Prints each line of the file.
- If the file does not exist, it shows an error message.

### File: `read_file.py`

## Task 2: Write and Append Data to a File
- Takes user input and writes it to `output.txt`.
- Appends additional user input to the same file.
- Displays the final content of the file.

### File: `write_append_file.py`

## How to Run
```bash
python read_file.py
python write_append_file.py
